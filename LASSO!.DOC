                                 ===========
        
                          ASCII -> DBF file converter

        What is LASSO?
        ==============
        
        LASSO! converts data in non-CSV ASCII files into DBF format 
        files. LASSO! would ideally be used in a situation where
        you wanted to convert data in an ASCII report file into DBF
        format. The fields of data in the ASCII file must be laid
        out in columns.
        
        Unlike most other programs of this type, LASSO! allows you to 
        view and scroll through your ASCII file and define your fields
        'on the fly'.
        
        LASSO! also allows you to ignore blank lines in your ASCII file 
        when you are converting to DBF format.
        
        
        
        Using LASSO!
        ============
        
        LASSO! is extremely simple and intuitive to use - the keys to 
        available options and menus are always displayed on the screen.
        
        When converting an ASCII to a DBF format file, you must have an 
        appropriate DBF file already set up. LASSO! will append to the 
        DBF file if it already contains any records.
        
        
        LASSO! demo limitations

        Differences from LASSO Version 1.00
        ===================================
        
        As such, this is Version 2.0 of LASSO! LASSO! V1.00 could
        only convert data in ASCII files of up to 80 characters
        in width, Version 2.0 can now handle ASCII files of up to
        260 characters in width.
        
	The few bugs that existed in Version 1.00 have now been
        ironed out.
